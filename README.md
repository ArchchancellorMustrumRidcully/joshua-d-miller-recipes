My recipes for autopkg https://github.com/autopkg


Please keep in mind the recipes Adobe Digital Editions, Box Sync, Exceed onDemand Client, Doceri Desktop, Google Voice and Video, Mendeley, RStudio, Stellarium, Studiocode, and TN3270X are just munki recipes for the download recipes created by @hansen_m.  These recipes MUST have his repo also in order to function.  His recipe repo can be found at https://github.com/autopkg/hansen-m-recipes/

The QnA recipe requires the download recipe created by @rustymyers.  His repo can be found at https://github.com/autopkg/rustymyers-recipes/

The Box Edit recipe should work fine in Munki.  Still I would recommend submitting a ticket for your organization to Box to let them know about their "enterprise" product.
